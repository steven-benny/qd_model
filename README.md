# Quantum Variational Eigensolver (Qiskit)

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Quantum Variational Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm using Qiskit. VQE is a quantum algorithm designed for finding the ground state of a given Hamiltonian. In this example, we consider a Hamiltonian represented as a sum of Pauli operators.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Qiskit installed. If not, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install qiskit
```

## Usage

Adjust the value of `num_qubits` to specify the desired number of qubits for the problem. The code defines a variational form circuit using single-qubit rotations (`Rx` gates) and constructs a Hamiltonian as a sum of Pauli operators.

The Pauli terms for the Hamiltonian are specified in the `pauli_terms` list. Feel free to modify this list based on your specific problem.

Run the script to perform a VQE simulation using the statevector simulator. The optimal parameters and ground state energy will be printed as results.

## Code Structure

- **Importing Libraries**: Necessary libraries from Qiskit are imported, including Qiskit Aer for simulation.

- **Variational Form Circuit**: The `variational_form` function generates a quantum circuit representing the variational form with adjustable parameters.

- **Hamiltonian Construction**: The Pauli terms for the Hamiltonian are defined, and the Hamiltonian is constructed as a sum of these terms.

- **VQE Computation**: The VQE algorithm is executed to find the ground state of the Hamiltonian. The SPSA optimizer is used, and the result is obtained using the statevector simulator.

- **Results Printing**: The optimal parameters and ground state energy are printed, along with additional information about the problem.

- **Variational Form Visualization**: The script visualizes the variational form circuit using the optimal parameters.

## Additional Information and Analysis

The script includes a section for providing additional information about the problem, such as the number of qubits and the Pauli terms in the Hamiltonian. Customize this section as needed for your analysis.

Feel free to extend the code for further analysis or visualization based on your specific requirements.
